                <h3>The Tapestry</h3>
                <p>
                    The tapestries were made in the second half of the 16th century, <br />
                    and were purchased for the house in 1894. <br />
                    <br />
                    Isak Gustaf Clason based his design for the whole room on them, <br />
                    both the size and the colour scheme. <br />
                    <br />
                    There is a total of six tapetstries; two hang in the Small Drawing Room. <br />
                    They represent the sixth song of the Odyssey <br />
                     where Odysseus (or Ulysses) meets Nausicaa.

                <h3>The Fireplace</h3>
                <p>
                    The fireplaces in the house never in fact had a practical use, <br />
                    as a modern central heating system with hot air was installed <br />
                    when the house was built. <br />
                    <br />
                    The purpose of the fireplaces is instead to reflect the different <br />
                    historical styles of the rooms.<br />
                    <br />
                    Above, the relief over the mantelpiece in Carrara marble <br />
                    was made by the sculptor Gusten Lindberg.

                <h3>The Ceiling</h3>
                <p>
                    This ceiling painting, by Julius Kronberg, alludes to the musical function of the room. <br />
                    On the right and left ends, there are two latin inscriptions. <br />
                    The title is “An Open-air concert”. <br />
                    <br />
                    ”Ars mollit vitam modulis vel imagine formans” means <br />
                    “Art and music beautify our lives”. <br />
                    <br />
                    ”Pulcra domus docto quasi musica fixa videtur” freely translated reads: <br />
                    “A beautiful house is for a connoisseur like music petrified”.

                <h3>The Grand Piano</h3>
                <p>
                    This Steinway Grand Piano was delivered in 1896 <br />
                    with a relatively simple, brown pear wood case. <br />
                    <br />
                    The architect, Isak Gustaf Clason, was asked to design <br />
                    a new case in a Baroque-inspired style, <br />
                    more in keeping with the decoration of the room. <br />
                    <br />
                    The instrument, which is unique of its kind, was restored in 1990 <br />
                    and is still kept in perfect concert pitch.

                <p>
                    The Hallwyl Museum is a private house from the turn of the century 1900. <br />
                    The house was inhabited until 1930 and has since been a state-owned museum <br />
                    which is now part of the National Historical Museums (SHM), a government agency. <br />
